# Infrastructure as Code (IAC)

This repository contains code and configurations for automating infrastructure deployment using Infrastructure as Code (IAC) practices. The code is designed to work with cloud platforms like AWS and leverages tools such as CloudFormation, Terraform, or Ansible for resource provisioning and management.

## Features

- Automated provisioning of cloud resources.
- Scalable and reusable infrastructure templates.
- Version-controlled infrastructure code.
- Simplifies cloud infrastructure management.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that AWS CLI or another cloud CLI is installed and configured on your machine.
- Install the required IAC tools, such as:
  - [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)
  - [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
  - [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Himanshusinghtomar/IAC.git

2. **Set up your cloud credentials**:
   Ensure that your AWS or cloud provider credentials are properly configured on your local machine.

3. **Run the scripts**:
   Follow the specific instructions for each IAC tool. For example, if you're using Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```
